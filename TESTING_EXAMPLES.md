## 🔬 Advanced Tests

### Test A: Sentiment Boundaries
Try these and watch the sentiment score:

| Message | Expected Sentiment | Confidence |
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| "This is absolutely amazing!" | Positive | >0.90 |
| "I'm okay, nothing special" | Neutral/Positive | 0.50-0.70 |
| "This is terrible and frustrating" | Negative | >0.85 |

### Test B: Context Memory
```
Step 1: Start conversation
"My name is Alex"

Step 2: Test if it remembers
"Do you remember my name?"

Step 3: Click "Reset Conversation"

Step 4: Ask again
"Do you remember my name?"

Expected: After reset, it won't remember!
```

---

### Test C: Response Variety
```
Try the SAME message 3 times:
(Reset conversation between each)

Try #1: "What's your favorite color?"
Try #2: (Reset) "What's your favorite color?"
Try #3: (Reset) "What's your favorite color?"

Expected: Different responses each time!
```

---

### Test D: Long Conversation
```
Have a 10+ message conversation on one topic.

For example, discuss your favorite movie:

2. Continue discussing specific movies
3. Talk about directors
4. Discuss plot elements
5. Compare to other genres
... keep going ...

Observe: Does context stay consistent?
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for Testing

### 1. **Watch the Confidence Scores**
```
"I love this!"           → ~0.97 (Very clear sentiment)
"It's alright I guess"   → ~0.65 (Ambiguous sentiment)
"This is terrible!"      → ~0.94 (Very clear sentiment)
```

### 2. **Test Multi-turn Context**
Start with a topic, then use pronouns:
```
"I bought a new car"
"It's red and very fast"     (AI knows "it" = car)
"Should I take it to work?"  (AI still remembers)
```

### 3. **Try Edge Cases**
```
Empty-ish messages:
- "..."
- "ok"
- "hmm"

Mixed sentiment:
- "I love it but also hate it"
- "It's great but disappointing"

Sarcasm (hard for AI):
- "Oh great, another problem"
- "Yeah, that's just perfect" (said negatively)
```

### 4. **Compare Before/After Reset**
- Have a conversation
- Note the context
- Click "Reset Conversation"
- Try same topics
- Responses will be different!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If responses seem weird:
1. **Click "Reset Conversation"**
   - Clears memory
   - Starts fresh

2. **Check if models are loaded**
   - Look for warning messages
   - Should see "Response generated by DialoGPT AI model"

3. **Try shorter messages**
   - Very long messages can confuse the model
   - Keep under 100 words for best results

### If sentiment seems wrong:
1. **Check confidence score**
   - Low confidence (<0.6) = model unsure
   - Ambiguous messages get lower scores

2. **Try clearer sentiment**
   - "I hate this" instead of "Not my favorite"
   - "I love it!" instead of "It's nice"
